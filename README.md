## Covid-19 Search Engine - part of Society Impact Project - Electronics and Electrical Communication Department - Faculty of Engineering - Cairo University - Dr. Hassan Mostafa

## Developed a website like a search engine for the medical community to help them in their fight against COVID-19 Under Supervision of Dr. Hassan Mostafa

### Please find attached the video with a demo for the website working at this link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx_NjmCFVeo)

### Kindly be noted that since the dataset is very large (12 GB) and running the code takes around +20 GB of RAM, we couldnâ€™t deploy it online because a server with these specs would cost too much But you can do it.
