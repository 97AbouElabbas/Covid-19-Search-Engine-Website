## Developed a website like a search engine for the medical community to help them in their fight against COVID-19 Under Supervision of Dr. Hassan Mostafa

### Kindly be noted that since the dataset is very large 8 GB and running the code takes around 16 GB of RAM, we couldnâ€™t deploy it online because a server with these specs would cost too much But you can do it.

### Under Supervision of:
* Dr Hassan Mostafa

### Submitted by:
